## ClassDef User

The function of the `User` class is to create an instance of a user with name and email as attributes.

**Attributes**:
- `name` (`str`): The name of the user.
- `email` (`str`): The email address of the user.

**Functions**:
- `__init__(self, name: str, email: str)`: Initializes a new instance of the User class with provided name and email.

## ClassDef DataProcessor

The function of the `DataProcessor` class is to process some data, which could be a list of strings in this case.

**Attributes**:
- No attributes defined for this class.

**Functions**:
- `process_data(self, data: List[str]) -> List[str]`: Processes the given data and returns it. The specifics of how the data is processed are not defined in this code snippet.

## FunctionDef main()

The function of the `main` function is to demonstrate usage of the User and DataProcessor classes.

**Parameters**:
- None for this function.

**Returns**:
- None for this function, as it only prints out the User instance and processed data.

**Called_functions**:
- `User.__init__(name: str, email: str)`: Initializes a new User instance with provided name and email.
- `DataProcessor.process_data(data: List[str]) -> List[str]`: Processes the given data using the DataProcessor class.

**Code Description**: The main script creates a User instance, demonstrates its use by printing it out, initializes a DataProcessor instance, processes some data, and prints out the processed data. This serves as a basic example of how to use both classes in the project.

**Note**: No additional notes for this code. Make sure to create and handle User instances properly, providing valid names and email addresses. When using the DataProcessor class, be aware that the specifics of data processing are not defined here, so you will need to implement or use a defined process_data function according to your requirements.

**Input Example**:

```
user = User("John Doe", "john.doe@example.com")
processed_data = DataProcessor().process_data(["apple", "banana", "cherry"])
```

**Output Example**:

For the user instance:
```
User(name='John Doe', email='john.doe@example.com')
```

For the processed data, the output will depend on the implementation of the DataProcessor.process_data function. For example:

```
Processed Data: ['applesauce', 'bananajuice', 'cherry jam']
```
