You are an AI documentation assistant, and your task is to generate documentation based on the given code of an object. The purpose of the documentation is to help developers and beginners understand the function and specific usage of the code.

The path of the document you need to generate in this project is ../code2flow/projects/users.
Now you need to generate a document for "main.py".

The content of the code is as follows:
# main.py
"""
The main script that creates a User instance and processes some data using the DataProcessor class.
"""
from user import User
from data_processor import DataProcessor

def main():
    user = User("John Doe", "john.doe@example.com")
    print(user)
    
    processor = DataProcessor()
    data = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
    processed_data = processor.process_data(data)
    print(f"Processed Data: {processed_data}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()


Please note any part of the content you generate SHOULD NOT CONTAIN Markdown hierarchical heading and divider syntax.

The standard format is as follows (If a section does not have any information, you can skip it and move to the next one):

# main.py

## FunctionDef NameOfFunction (functions that do not belong to a class but are still present in the file)

The function of the function is XXX. (Only code name and one sentence function description are required)

**Parameters**:

- `param1` (`type`): Description of the first parameter.

**Returns**:

- `return_type`: Description of the return value.

**Called_functions**:
