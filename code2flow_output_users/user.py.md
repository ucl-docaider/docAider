**Code Description**: 

The User class utilizes the uuid library to generate unique IDs for each user. It initializes a new user with their name and email, providing a way to uniquely identify users. The `__str__` method allows for string representation of users, while the `update_email` function enables updating of user emails.

**Note**: 

- When using this class, ensure that you provide valid input (name and email) to avoid errors.
- This class does not include any validation or error handling for the generated ID or provided name and email. You may need to add additional code for these scenarios depending on your specific use case.

**Input Example**: 
```
User("John Doe", "johndoe@example.com")
```

This example demonstrates the initialization of a User object with a given name and email. The `update_email` function can be used as follows:

```
user = User("John Doe", "johndoe@example.com")
user.update_email("newmail@example.com")
```

**Output Example**: 
```
User [ID: 12345678-9abc-def0-1234-567890abcdef, Name: John Doe, Email: newmail@example.com]
```
