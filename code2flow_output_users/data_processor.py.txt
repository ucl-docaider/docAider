You are an AI documentation assistant, and your task is to generate documentation based on the given code of an object. The purpose of the documentation is to help developers and beginners understand the function and specific usage of the code.

The path of the document you need to generate in this project is ../code2flow/projects/users.
Now you need to generate a document for "data_processor.py".

The content of the code is as follows:
# data_processor.py
from utils import validate_email

"""
Contains the DataProcessor class which has methods for processing data and checking the validity of email addresses using the function from utils.py.
"""
class DataProcessor:
    def process_data(self, data):
        return [item.upper() for item in data]
    
    def check_emails(self, emails):
        return [validate_email(email) for email in emails]


Please note any part of the content you generate SHOULD NOT CONTAIN Markdown hierarchical heading and divider syntax.

The standard format is as follows (If a section does not have any information, you can skip it and move to the next one):

# data_processor.py

Please generate a detailed explanation document for this object based on the code of the target object itself. For the section Called_functions, considering the additional documentation for the functions and classes called within the file:

Function/Class utils::validate_email:


def validate_email(email):
    pattern = '^[a-z0-9]+[\\._]?[a-z0-9]+[@]\\w+[.]\\w+$'
    if re.match(pattern, email):
        return True
    return False
